datadriven implementation of parallel graph coloring on GPGPUs using FristFit strategy

program read mtx or gr graph and store its information in CSR format

and write colors of all vertices to "color.txt"

program has two variants.

datadriven_naive:	use worklist to improve work effiency, reduce atomic operation

using block scan

datadriven_ldg:		based on datadriven_naive, use __ldg to read C and R array

from read_only cache


usage:
	./datadriven_naive <graph>
	./datadriven_ldg <graph>
