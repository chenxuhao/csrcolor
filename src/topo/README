topology implementation of parallel graph coloring on GPGPUs using FristFit strategy

program read mtx or gr graph and store its information in CSR format

and write colors of all vertices to "color.txt"

program has two variants.

topodriven_naive:	naive implementation without any optimization

topodriven_ldg:		use __ldg to read C and R array from read_only cache


usage:
	./topodriven_naive <blocksize> <graph>
	./topodriven_ldg <blocksize> <graph>
