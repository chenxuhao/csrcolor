Graph Coloring (GCO) partitions the vertices of a graph such that
no two adjacent matrices share the same color.  

3-step graph coloring framework: 
1) Graph partitioning which partitions graph into subgraphs and 
identifies boundary vertices, 
2) graph coloring & conflicts detection which colors the graph using 
the specified heuristic, e.g. FF, and identifies color conflicts, and
3) sequential conflicts resolution which goes back to CPU and resolves 
the conflicts.
