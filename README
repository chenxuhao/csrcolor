This is the code for sequential graph coloring on CPU and CUDA code for parallel graph coloring on GPGPUs.

Variants:
csrcolor:	graph coloring routine of NVIDIA cusparse		
3-step-GM:	parallel graph coloring implemented on GPGPUs by Grosset et al.
sequential:	sequential graph coloring using FirstFit strategy
datadriven:	datadriven implementation of parallel graph coloring using FirstFit strategy
topodriven:	topodriven implementation of parallel graph coloring using FirstFit strategy


Requirements:
        compute capability 3.5 and higher
        Kepler or later GPU hardware
        CUB v1.1.1

The instructions below assume CSRCOLOR_CODE has been installed in $CSRCOLOR_CODE_DIR.

Each variant directory under $CSRCOLOR_CODE_DIR/$VARIANT contains a README that
explains what $VARIANT does, how to run it, details of implementations
and other useful info.


INSTALLATION

You will need to download and install CUB from here:

http://nvlabs.github.io/cub/

Place a symlink to the top-level CUB directory in $CSRCOLOR_CODE_DIR. Assuming
the top-level CUB directory is $CUBDIR:

$ cd $CSRCOLOR_CODE_DIR
$ ln -s $CUBDIR


BUILDING

Assuming you're in $CSRCOLOR_CODE_DIR:
$ make # compiles all variants


RUNNING

Each variant directory under $CSRCOLOR_CODE_DIR contains a simple `run' script that
runs the application with all recommended inputs.
